#  ## Flashcards

## Lab 3

### App Description
A simple iOS flashcards application where the user is presented a flashcard question and given 3 choices. If the user chooses the wrong answer, the answer is hidden. If the user chooses the right answer, the flashcard question is hidden and shows the answer.

It's been updated to now show the user a creation screen, give the user the ability to dismiss the screen, passes data, shows the user an error if the question or answers are blank, gives the option to edit an existing flashcard, and gives the user the ability to create his/her own multiple choice question in the creation screen.

User can now browse through multiple flashcards, re-open the app to see previously created flashcards, delete flashcards, edit existing flashcards and can store multiple choice questions.
