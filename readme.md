#  ## Flashcards

## Lab 4

### App Description
A simple iOS flashcards application where the user is presented a flashcard question and given 3 choices. If the user chooses the wrong answer, the answer is hidden. If the user chooses the right answer, the flashcard question is hidden and shows the answer.

Edit: It's been updated to now show the user a creation screen, give the user the ability to dismiss the screen, passes data, shows the user an error if the question or answers are blank, gives the option to edit an existing flashcard, and gives the user the ability to create his/her own multiple choice question in the creation screen.

Edit part 2: User can now browse through multiple flashcards, re-open the app to see previously created flashcards, delete flashcards, edit existing flashcards and can store multiple choice questions.

Edit part 3: User can now see an app icon, a splash screen, a flip animation when showing the answer, and a slide animation going to the next and previous flashcard. There are also extra features, the right answer's location is now randomized, the app is now responsive, and they should see a nicer flashcard with rounded corners, shadows, and animating when showing for the first time.
